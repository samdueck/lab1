Created a webpage with a header, footer, and sidebar with some small design features including navigation, carousel, and css styling.
I worked alone and became familiar with how to use git / git commands. It took me a bit initially to get used to the commands after creating the repository and I had to do a fair amount of testing/trial and errors. But if you disregard the initial testing, then over the past few days you will see the actual work towards the lab including creating branches to implement new features, making pull requests, merging branches, deleting branches, etc.
